      <p class="lyrics">
        I took my love and I took it down <br>
        Climbed a mountain and I turned around <br>
        And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills <br>
        Till the landslide brought me down<br>
        Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?<br>
        Can the child within my heart rise above?<br>
        And can I sail through the changing ocean tides<br>

        I'm getting older too<br>
        Oh I'm getting older too<br>
        Oh, take my love, take it down<br>
